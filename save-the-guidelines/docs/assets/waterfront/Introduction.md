# Introduction 

## Why asset guidelines?

The island country of Bahrain has a wealth of cultural, historical, landscape and ecological assets that distinguish it from other countries in the Middle East tourist value.
A landscape policy must be drafted. To do so requires approach rooted in Bahrain’s national identity and developing a shared vision of the country’s landscape. This approach, targeting generally recognized assets, pursues three key successive courses of action:

- Identify and protect most sensitive sites;
- Promote sites of interest;
- Expand by creating links between protected and promoted sites.

These courses of action will be launched from protected areas around which Special Planning Areas (SPA’s) will be defined in the immediate or more distant vicinity. **For each of these SPA s, dedicated guidelines will have to be respected. (Strategic Plan)**
The asset guidelines comprise three sets of recommendations and best practices to be implemented close to protected areas, namely: Heritage Asset Guidelines, Waterfront Asset Guidelines and Green Asset Guidelines. These recommendations specific to each typology of assets complement the recommendations of the Project Guidelines, which apply to all major development projects, and the Public Waterfront guidelines, which apply to the public Waterfront. 

## Why Guidelines for the Waterfront?

**The Waterfront is a major asset for Bahrain.** 
The Kingdom of Bahrain is an island whose relationship with the sea is of fundamental importance. 
Shipbuilding, maritime trade and fishing have been the island’s major historic lines of business. More recently, the EDB has identified tourism and leisure as being among the island’s four key investment sectors. In terms of conservation and development, turning the Waterfront into a major Bahraini tourist attraction has become a priority. 
The waterfront is a central area for the wellbeing of Bahrainis, GCC visitors and international tourists. It is an environment with:

- marine valuable resources
- a high urbanization and a concentration of major mobilities;
- many Mega projects developed, underway or planned;
- a wealth of cultural and heritage assets;
- a diversity of landscapes.

the overarching goal of these guidelines is to make the Waterfront more resilient and reach sustainable development goals:

- Secure space for public use on Waterfront
- Restoring continuity and guarantee a public access to the coastline;
- Facilitate the access to the coastline : pedestrian, public transport, non-motorized modes;
- Ensure physical and visual connection to the waterfront through a specific landscape.

For the long-term enhancement of the coastline, it is necessary to protect its most fragile stretches. The following protected spaces must not be developed at all. 

- public beaches
- wild stretches of coastline
- marine resources

**In the following most valuable places, i.e. the Special Planning Areas (SPAs), development must be kept under control:** 

- **built-up areas**
- **beach areas**
- **land reclamations.** 

**The Waterfront Guidelines make a series of recommendations to developers and instructors involved in residential or mixed-use projects on how to preserve, enhance and develop the Bahraini coastline.** 
These recommendations do not apply to developers of strictly industrial or business projects. 

## Les Special Planning Areas

3 types de SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS waterfront sont à développer au regard de specific recommendations:
in developed areas, the NLP designates a 300 meter wide strip where specific recommendations apply, il s’agit des SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS (SPAs). On distingue 3 SPAs différentes en fonction de leur localisation sur la côte et leur destination.
***Built up Waterfront**         
Dans les areas urbanisées, la National Land Policy identifie une bande de 300 m d’épaisseur en partant du trait de côte, dans laquelle un soin particulier sera apporté aux développements pour en faire des espaces de vie, animés de jour comme de nuit toute l’année. L’identité de chacune des séquences du littoral urbain devra être mise en valeur. 
***Built-up Waterfront**         
In urbanised areas, the National Land Policy identifies a 300m wide exclusion strip on the coastline in which special care will be taken of developments to ensure they are lively by day and by night all year round. The distinctive identity of each sequence along the urban coastline will be highlighted. 

- ***Beach areas**

The development of spaces close to public beaches must highlight proximity to the sea and direct access to the water. Areas close to the beaches will be dedicated to leisure activities accessible to the general public. 

- ***Reclamation**

In areas where developments in the sea are authorised by the Strategic Plan, they must pay particular attention to defining new identities, while limiting any impacts on the marine environment.
