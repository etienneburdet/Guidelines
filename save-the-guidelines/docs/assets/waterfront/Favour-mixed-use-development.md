# Favour mixed-use development  
On the whole, the coastal spaces are attractive in terms of the diversity of programmes and users, encompassing informal and economic uses (fishing, horse-riding, housing, hospitality, service sector activities, etc.). This ensures the vitality of the Waterfront all year round, by day and by night. 

***The principles laid down in this chapter are based on those laid down in the Project Guidelines.***  

# General Programming Principles

*A diversity of urban functions and construction programmes is planned along the coastline: their strategic importance is due to their being located on the coastline rather than in other parts of Bahrain.* 

- Programming will alternate quiet coastline segments with livelier ones; 
- *Respect linear continuity featuring complementary centres of varying intensity.*
- Programming will endeavour to maintain existing activities, income generating or leisure, and ensure new development improves conditions and operations. To that purpose, consultation with existing users should be undertaken at the programming stage.

## Exclusion strip 

*An unbuilt area made up of open spaces and light structures.* 

- No building will be permitted, except for light, temporary structures. 
- The non-constructible area will be mainly dedicated to non-motorised low-impact modes of mobility and to open spaces.
- The programme will include visitor information facilities. 
## Seafront 

*This area corresponds to the first built frontage and to the exits of the perpendicular access ways to the sea.* 

- The programme will sustain or enhance pre-existing uses, be they leisure (swimming, horse-riding) or economic (fishing, arts and crafts). 
- Land uses that impose restrictions on access will be prohibited in order to ensure public access to the beach and easements for pedestrian access (resorts, compounds, etc.). 
- The programming of activities relating directly to the Waterfront will evolve over time (temporary use/occupation of vacant lots, etc.). 
- **Residential** land uses will be balanced between locals, expats and tourists. 
- The **hotel** construction programmes will favour structures that respect the natural environment and landscape, and which complement the existing hotel offering. 
- **Parking lots** will not be visible on the seafront. Their preferred location will be landside. 
- Seafront **facilities** that meet the needs of local residents shall be accessible for both residents and visitors. It will be given the possibility of derogating from the maximum authorised distances between them;
## Landside  
- favour services and facilities that meet the needs of residents, economically active people and visitors to foster a diversity of users. 
- Projects that do not feature continuity with an existing urban fabric will have to be particularly autonomous from an employment point of view (with an Employment Concentration Indicator of between 0.6 and 1);
- dynamic **hubs** will be located at the interface between tourist areas and neighbouring living quarters. They will be easily accessible from the seafront;
- Developments located near the Waterfront will have to set their supply of parking spaces back from the seafront 


# Specific Requirements per SPA

***Beach areas**
*Public spaces are fragile and not numerous in this part of the city, so public access to it must be organised. More amenities need to be introduced taking into account developments in the immediate vicinity.*

- The programme will ensure that the public can use the beaches, which means preventing privatisation by establishing spaces open to the public and accessible by non-motorized pathways all along the coastline.
- The programme lays down the linear development of walkways or non-motorised low-impact connections set back from the beach to delineate the entrance to the public space and to clearly indicate the urbanisation boundary.
- The construction programme for each segment will have to meet the needs of a broad range of users (including spaces for workers or tourists to change clothes and picnic and playgrounds for residents' children, et.).
