# Ensure public access to the waterfront
*Access to the waterfront is key to enhancing this asset. Continuity along it and connection between it and areas to its back are to be provided to ensure use and enjoyment by the public and reestablishing a strong relationship with the sea.* 
*This part provides planning and design guidance for those linkages including for specific requirements for roads in the Waterfront area.* 

## Create linear continuities

**Create promenades along large segments of the waterfront**
**Exclusion strip:**

- Exclusion strip of minimum 10m will be non-constructible and landscaped;
- Only light and temporary constructions could be accepted; 
- Mobility network and open spaces located on this exclusion strip should be connected to adjacent developments;
- Pedestrian access easement shall always be located on exclusion strip; 
- This exclusion strip is part of coastal protection against erosion as described in part 5;

**Pedestrian access easement:**
Moving along the Waterfront will be allowed by means of a public pedestrian access easement. 

- The easement’s strip of land may remain privately owned so long as the right to cross it is made possible. 
- It will be 6m wide in most contexts. Some 1.5m wide pedestrian easements could be accepted in very constrained sites or residential areas. 
- To provide continuity along the Waterfront, it will be connected to the surrounding road network and open spaces, if any. 
- If a residential road is planned by the sea, the pedestrian easement will be integrated into it (the road profile will have to be adapted). 
- The design of edges on both sides as well as on city side will avoid any "walling off" effect to favour a "plug in" design. 
- The pedestrian easement will be continuous between two contiguous projects in terms of width, surfacing, levelling. A financial contribution by riparian owners will enable the easement to be created and kept in good condition by the local authority. 

*Pedestrian easements accessible to the public should be developed whose width will vary according to the sites. (A minimum width of 1.5m in front of private residential developments or very constrained sites).*

***Beaches areas**

- A 100-metre-wide exclusion strip alongside the beaches free of any form of urban development must be respected. 
- Light and removable structures may be proposed in this strip. They must relate to fishing or beach activities (restaurants, clubs, children’s games, fish markets, etc.) and must not adversely affect the sites). 
- Public spaces must help guide users towards the beaches (signage, landscaping, etc.), facilitate their access to them and preserve the quality of the coastline. 
- Shops and leisure facilities must be easily accessible from the beaches and public ports. 

***Reclamation**

- 80% of shoreline land reclaims must be accessible to the public in the form of open spaces and spaces for non-motorised low impact modes of transport. Linear shore developments will include the canals inside reclaimed spaces.
- *Rendre accessible 80 % des berges sur reclaim*

**Vary the relationships with the sea by developing the shores** 
The following guidance will apply to the exclusion strip:

- Each development will be consistent with the type of seafront concerned (see Strategic Plan) and, if necessary, with the recommendations specific to the relevant sectors (see the public space charter, etc.). 
- The treatment of the coastline will feature diversified overhanging terraces or pathways, islands and floating jetties, piers, etc.). 
- Development of the shores will have to ensure continuity between the different developments (in terms of profile and width). 
- Coarse rock protection (riprap) will not exceed 30% of the coastline. Embankments allowing access to the water (steps, etc.) will be favoured. 
- Direct access points to water will be placed every 300m at the most. 
- The development of walkways very close to the water (low level walkways) will be favoured. This type of walkway also guarantees the privacy of adjacent homes (see Ch. 4.2 on boundaries). ).

## Facilitate access to the coastline from adjacent neighbourhoods

**Create transversal access**

- Access to the waterfront via public access ways shall be ensured at least every 500 m.
- These access ways will give priority to non-motorized mobility modes and have at least the width of a footpath (see Road Hierarchy of the Strategic Plan and Project Guidelines);
- All new development in contact with the waterfront shall provide new access way to it, even if it is located between two existing access easements distant from 500m or less.
- These access ways will preferably be rectilinear to ensure view corridors towards the coastline (see 4.1);

*Un accès public au rivage doit être assuré tous les 500 m à minima*

***Built up Waterfront**   

- In the built-up parts of the Waterfront, access to the shore from public roads must be provided at least every 300 metres. 
- Access ways to the shoreline should ensure continuity with the existing road network. 
- When developing corridors, priority will be given to direct connections with public transport stops and stations (bus, LRT, etc.). 
- When there are obstacles (expressways, etc), connections will be provided using elevated or underground structures. 
- elevated or underground access ways will be attractive and comfortable, with ramps for bicycles and prams as well as shade and water supply. 
- *There must be access ways to the shore from public roads at least every 300 metres in built-up areas*

*The number of pedestrian corridors leading to the shoreline must be multiplied and take the most suitable forms (pedestrian crossings, footbridges, etc.)*

***Beaches areas**

- The developments will make access to the beaches easier by including a public transport line featuring:  
  - a stop next to the beach itself
  - alleyways and corridors guiding passengers to the beaches 
- Parking lots will be clearly identified and delineated. They should be as invisible as possible from the seafront (integrated landscaping, plantations, incline, etc.) 

If part of the beach is conceded to private operators, the 1.5 meter-wide (minimum) transversal and longitudinal pedestrian easements will be maintained.

*Access to public beaches must be facilitated by a good connection with public transport facilities near the public parking lots*



## Turning the Waterfront into a showcase for virtuous modes of mobility

**Foster the integration of public transport and road sharing**

- The road network shall adapt to the national tourism strategy (BTEA shall be consulted). The dimensions of access ways to the sea (capacity and parking) will depend on programming (land use and the expected number of users). 
- A specific road order shall be developed for the pedestrian transversal and longitudinal access easement and the coastal promenades. In line with the local and national mobility plan (Strategic Plan), the road profiles will ensure the integration:
  - of public transport: integrated bus lines, BRT, tramway lines;
  - of non-motorized mobility modes: pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, etc;
  - of innovative forms of mobility: self-service bike sharing, shuttle services.

*One-way street* 

**Improve connectivity between shore and islands**

- Pedestrian crossings and maritime transport links (taxi boats, etc.) may connect shores;
- Foster public transport via waterways connecting different areas;
- Pedestrian access to private islands, their roads and shorelines will be authorised.
- Treatment of the coastline will favour the mooring of boats. Landing stages for boat shuttles (water taxis) will be available every 500m in dense urban areas.

**Effective integration of heavy infrastructures**

- Seaside roads with heavy traffic (Distributor roads and above) will be turned into peaceful urban boulevards thanks to speed limits, traffic lights, suitably dimensioned roads, public transport lanes, wide sidewalks and street-level (ground floor) retail outlets, etc.
- Local roads will optimize the functioning of services related to tourism and ports. Their integration into the immediate environment will be studied to avoid visual and physical barriers;
- The presence of heavy infrastructures (highways, utility corridors, elevated transport lines, etc) along the coast will be avoided as much as possible on the water's edge. Otherwise, the following principles will apply:
- They will be well-integrated into their environment to avoid visual and physical barriers. 
- Their impact will be limited thanks to devices such as plantations and the permeability and porosity characteristics of materials for ground cover.
- Their presence will be offset by the development of:
  - Adjacent protected walkways for non-motorised mobility
  - Open and/or natural spaces developed onsite or elsewhere 
  - The positioning of regular crossings (see 3.2)

***Built up Waterfront**     

- The impact of heavy roads infrastructures on the Waterfront such as motorways must be reduced as much as possible with the help of various devices:
- Creating buffer zones using recesses and spaces with green plants, etc. 
- Locating buildings that act as screens, such as office blocks, closed sports facilities shopping centres, etc.  
- Burying new roads
