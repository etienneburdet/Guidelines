# Sustainable coastal developments

## Greening the Waterfront 
- Waterfront developments must contribute to recreating the vegetable cover:
  - The selected species of vegetable will help to stabilise the soil, reinforce biodiversity and depollute the ground.
  - By providing shade and freshness (irrigated gardens), the selected vegetable species will enhance the comfort of pedestrian public spaces.
  - The chosen vegetable species will make it possible to create a unique landscape (in terms of heights, colours, etc.)
  - The vegetable pallets will be compatible with their coastline location and the overall objectives set in part 5 of the "Green Guidelines" manual.
- At least 30% of the surface area of the exclusion strip will be planted. Waterfront linear parks will be introduced.
## Adapting developments to movements of the coastline and avoiding erosion
- Developments shall not stop the natural movement of the coastline:
  - Fixed structures that make the ground rigid are to be avoided, such as foundations, works involving injections into the soil, etc.;
  - Means of stabilisation and demarcation (plantations, cable barriers, etc.) should be flexible rather than rigid (parapets, dykes);
  - Pedestrian walkways right next to the coastline shall be adaptable to changing coastal movements: wooden paths, planted paths, etc;
- Developments shall not accelerate the erosion of the coastline:
  - Grassy areas should be preserved;
  - Digging in development areas shall be limited as much as possible, particularly if they contain sludge or vegetation;

## Limit wastewater discharges
- Developments in waterfront areas should avoid discharge of wastewater into the sea by using the collective wastewater disposal network. In the rare cases where this solution may not be possible:
  - A note shall be published proving that all alternative solutions to discharging have been studied;
  - Parcel-based treatment should be implemented to produce dischargeable effluent compliant with the chosen benchmarks (e.g. LEED: tertiary treatment level, HQE: chemical characteristics etc.)
## Materials

**Giving priority to materials and developments with the longest possible life-cycles**

- All forms of reinforced concrete will be calculated to achieve long-term resilience in marine environments. This also applies to non-immersed structures: use of cement suitable for sea water; use of stainless steel frames or of cathodic protection; water/binder ratio ranging from 0.5 to 0.45, etc.;
- Study the option of using wood to make structures subject to drawdown: piers, pontoons, stilts, etc.;
- Suitable protective covering will be used (coating, resin, etc.) to ensure the durability of fa√ßades and solar production subject to abrasion and scratching.
- Light infrastructures located in the exclusion strip must be mobile and partly replaceable (e.g. replacing part of the planks of a walkway). They should not require heavy deconstruction work in case of coastline movements.

- Check that the project meets general standards applicable to materials (e.g. the percentage of glazed surface area) and check the means used to prevent corrosion and abrasion (e.g. protection of reinforced concrete parts). | Favour naturally resistant solutions (e.g. wood, stones, composite materials for structures subject to draw downs) over active solutions (e.g. anode zinc for reinforcements)
Use international feedback. |
