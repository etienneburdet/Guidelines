# Stage the waterfront

## Reveal the coastal and seaboard landscape

*The various schemes proposed here enable people to feel the presence of the seafront on different scales, reminding them of the insular nature of the Kingdom's identity.*

### Improve the perception of the sea from the coast and the adjacent neighbourhoods
- Depending on each site's geographical context (heights, contours, etc.) it is necessary to preserve the existing views of the sea and to plan extra vistas;
- Points of interest will be highlighted by developing vantage points (belvederes, etc.):
  - wherever the shape of the coast is suitable (capes, etc.);
  - wherever facing remarkable coastal landscape (islands, urban or port skylines, etc.);
- Set the hierarchy of views in accordance with the requirements of the developments.

### Create a remarkable "coastal landscape"

- The planning of seafront built and non-built forms helps to create a coastal landscape visible from the sea and the coastline facing each other;
- The diversity of built forms should ensure avoidance of monotonous urban frontage and the emergence of a remarkable skyline;
- Planners will seek to find the appropriate seaboard sequences to highlight unique places and extend the range of uses;
- These sequences will leverage existing landmarks such as the natural heritage or historic monuments or even new future landmarks such as public space facilities (structures designed to command fine views, art installations, lighting, etc.);
- The streetscapes and built forms shall be consistent with the landscaping strategy and well integrated into landscaped corridors or facing remarkable vistas.

*Points of interest and various views highlighted*

## Invent a waterfront sense of place

### Attractive and comfortable public spaces

- In addition to the recommendations given in Part 3, the coastal promenade will be shaded (30% of the linear length) and provide drinking water supply points at regular intervals (every 300m);
- Developments will be accessible to persons with reduced mobility.
- The comfort of pedestrians' and a variety of user walkways and promenades will be enhanced thanks to shading and cooling features:
  - shade houses, vegetation, arcades;
  - the use of materials that reduce noise and heat;
  - lighting
  - keeping sources of heat at a distance (A/C emissions, cars parked with engines running, etc.);
  - The technical properties of materials for pavements and ground cover shall ensure maximum noise reduction and mitigation of the effects of heat.
- Public spaces shall be serviced by transport facilities (public transport, parking lots, etc.); this recommendation shall apply as a priority to coastal promenades and access corridors;
- Materials and furniture shall facilitate legibility.

### Boundaries that enhance the quality of the landscape

- The first alignment of buildings will benefit from the view onto the sea while preserving a sufficient degree of privacy;
- The privacy of residential developments will be treated by other means than blind walls (forbidden): inclines, light shafts, depth of plantations, etc.
- Setbacks and unbuilt parts of plots will be sufficiently wide to be usable (for gardens, patios, etc.) and will preferably be planted;
- If the coastal promenade (pedestrian longitudinal easement) is located right in front of the first line of buildings, an exclusion strip at least two meters wide will be respected and preferably planted.

***Built up Waterfront**

- Le paysage et le mobilier urbains doivent faciliter les déplacements de la ville jusqu’au front de mer;
- Ils doivent être reliés à des moyens de transport (transports publics, parkings...).
| ***Beach areas**

- Set back from the beaches (exclusion zone), the recommended open spaces will be generously planted with vegetation to:
  - provide shaded spaces for picnicking and other uses;
  - highlight the views on to the sea;
  - accommodate and integrate parking lots and the light structures recommended for this strip;
  - offer an alternation of dry and "fresh" irrigated gardens.
- 80% of spaces dedicated to pedestrian access ways must be shaded between 9am and 4pm. |


***Beaches areas**

- Les structures temporaires et les dispositifs d’éclairage peuvent être autorisés sur les plages ou dans leur zones tampons.
- Ils doivent être localisés de manières à permettre l’accès et la visibilité du waterfront.

## Adapt built forms

**Create a coastal urban front**

- For mega projects, this means defining architectural sequences that are relevant to land and coastal uses. Height variations will create a dynamic waterfront, displaying various views /images;
- All waterfront developments should feature both seaside and landside façades. If the main façade is seaside, the other façade will be treated with the same care. Blind facades are forbidden on the seaside and shall be avoided;
- The architecture of the buildings facing the sea will take advantage of this situation with openings, balconies, loggias, etc;
- Technical structures of all kinds (reservoirs, AC, aerials, displays, etc.) will have to be integrated into the façades and the roofs;
- Electricity substations will be incorporated into the buildings. They will not be placed on the seafront or in the visual fields of the transversal corridors. They will be located in accordance with the need for accessibility/visibility.

**Ensure porosity of the urban façade**

- New developments or buildings shall not obstruct views on the waterfront;
- Building footprint shall be maximum 50% of total site area;
- Limit barrier effect by limiting facade length:
  - The built up ratio over total length of the frontage should not be more than 70%
  - Continuous built facade should not be more than 30m
  - Limit heights with ascending height further away from the sealine, taller buildings should be located inland.

***Built up Waterfront**

- Views of the sea visible between buildings will be multiplied
- The planned new buildings will respect continuity with existing buildings to preserve visual openings between buildings.
- Priority will be given to developments on vacant land in sectors whose urbanisation has not been completed. In other words, before developing non-urbanised sectors, the lots for development in already urbanised sectors must be 80% built.

The new plantations remind people of the existing plantations; they help to embellish the site; they contribute to the implementation of the shading strategy. | A map on the same scale as the neighbourhood and its vicinity will make it possible to assess the positioning of the open spaces in the neighbourhood in relation with the Waterfront. The accessibility could be shown by using isochrones.  
A map of plantation will make it possible to assess their consistency of plantations with past and existing uses

| - Plan of heights
- Mass plan of buildings to be built / to be transformed; the location of buildings within the plots will depend on the location of the lots and land use;
- Facades and roofs will have certain architectural features and requirements
- The range of materials and colours will be specified | The defined heights and the ground plan must be consistent with the overall landscape  
The architectural inputs will contribute to creating a specific identity.                                | -Building heights; building volumes;
-the composition of the facades and roofs;
- material used                                                                                                                                                                                                   | - Check that the heights are consistent with the purpose of the site and its intensity.
- Check that the volumes fit the existing urban fabric.
- Check that the definition of rough-hewn stone, the location of buildings and their architecture enhance the views of the sea.

- Check that the footprint is maximum 50%;
 - Check that the "wall effect" has been avoided on the Waterfront; at least 30% of the urban facade should opened.
 - Check that the technical elements are not visible from the sea and that there is no rear facade;
 - Check the relevance of the proposed range of materials and colours in terms of their integration into the environment and their compatibility with the project's sense of place. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
