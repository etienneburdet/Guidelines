This document relates to **community developments**, i.e. medium-sized developments as described in the table below.
It complements the manual dedicated to large-scale urban projects. In this way, a large-scale urban project steered, in the first place, by the Megaproject Guidelines will also be guided by the Major Subdivision Guidelines or by particular specifications set by the operator of the large-scale project, which themselves are in line with the Major Subdivision Guidelines.
At community development level, Guidelines propose planning principles and rules for programming, site layout, including subdivision plan, mobility, road network and street design, public and green space, building design.
