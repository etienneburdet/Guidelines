This approach, targeting generally recognized assets, pursues three key successive courses of action:\n\n\n\n\nIdentify and protect most sensitive sites;\n\n\nPromote sites of interest;\n\n\nExpand by creating links between protected and promoted sites.\n\n\n\n\nThese courses of action will be launched from protected areas around which Special Planning Areas (SPA\u2019s) will be defined in the immediate or more distant vicinity. \nFor each of these SPA s, dedicated guidelines will have to be respected. (Strategic Plan)\n\nThe asset guidelines comprise three sets of recommendations and best practices to be implemented close to protected areas, namely: Heritage Asset Guidelines, Waterfront Asset Guidelines and Green Asset Guidelines. These recommendations specific to each typology of assets complement the recommendations of the Project Guidelines, which apply to all major development projects, and the Public Waterfront guidelines, which apply to the public Waterfront. \n\n\nWhy Guidelines for the Waterfront?\n\n\nThe Waterfront is a major asset for Bahrain.\n \nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is an island whose relationship with the sea is of fundamental importance. \nShipbuilding, maritime trade and fishing have been the island\u2019s major historic lines of business.

The distinctive identity of each sequence along the urban coastline will be highlighted.    *Beach areas   The development of spaces close to public beaches must highlight proximity to the sea and direct access to the water.

            "text": "Favour mixed-use development\n\n\nOn the whole, the coastal spaces are attractive in terms of the diversity of programmes and users, encompassing informal and economic uses (fishing, horse-riding, housing, hospitality, service sector activities, etc.). This ensures the vitality of the Waterfront all year round, by day and by night. \n\n\nThe principles laid down in this chapter are based on those laid down in the Project Guidelines.\n  \n\n\nGeneral Programming Principles\n\n\nA diversity of urban functions and construction programmes is planned along the coastline: their strategic importance is due to their being located on the coastline rather than in other parts of Bahrain.\n \n\n\n\n\nProgramming will alternate quiet coastline segments with livelier ones; \n\n\nRespect linear continuity featuring complementary centres of varying intensity.\n\n\nProgramming will endeavour to maintain existing activities, income generating or leisure, and ensure new development improves conditions and operations. To that purpose, consultation with existing users should be undertaken at the programming stage.\n\n\n\n\n**\n\n\nSpecific Requirements for each perimetre\n\n\n\n\nExclusion strip\n\n\nAn unbuilt area made up of open spaces and light structures.\n \n\n\n\n\nNo building will be permitted, except for light, temporary structures. \n\n\nThe non-constructible area will be mainly dedicated to non-motorised low-impact modes of mobility and to open spaces.\n\n\nThe programme will include visitor information facilities. \n\n\n\n\nSeafront\n\n\nThis area corresponds to the first built frontage and to the exits of the perpendicular access ways to the sea.\n \n\n\n\n\nThe programme will sustain or enhance pre-existing uses, be they leisure (swimming, horse-riding) or economic (fishing, arts and crafts). \n\n\nLand uses that impose restrictions on access will be prohibited in order to ensure public access to the beach and easements for pedestrian access (resorts, compounds, etc.). \n\n\nThe programming of activities relating directly to the Waterfront will evolve over time (temporary use/occupation of vacant lots, etc.). \n\n\nResidential\n land uses will be balanced between locals, expats and tourists. \n\n\nThe \nhotel\n construction programmes will favour structures that respect the natural environment and landscape, and which complement the existing hotel offering. \n\n\nParking lots\n will not be visible on the seafront. Their preferred location will be landside. \n\n\nSeafront \nfacilities\n that meet the needs of local residents shall be accessible for both residents and visitors. It will be given the possibility of derogating from the maximum authorised distances between them;\n\n\n\n\nLandside\n\n\n\n\nfavour services and facilities that meet the needs of residents, economically active people and visitors to foster a diversity of users. \n\n\nProjects that do not feature continuity with an existing urban fabric will have to be particularly autonomous from an employment point of view (with an Employment Concentration Indicator of between 0.6 and 1);\n\n\ndynamic \nhubs\n will be located at the interface between tourist areas and neighbouring living quarters. They will be easily accessible from the seafront;\n\n\nDevelopments located near the Waterfront will have to set their supply of parking spaces back from the seafront \n\n\n\n\nSpecific Requirements per SPA\n\n\nBeach areas\n\n\nPublic spaces are fragile and not numerous in this part of the city, so public access to it must be organised. More amenities need to be introduced taking into account developments in the immediate vicinity.*\n\n\n\n\nThe programme will ensure that the public can use the beaches, which means preventing privatisation by establishing spaces open to the public and accessible by non-motorized pathways all along the coastline.\n\n\nThe programme lays down the linear development of walkways or non-motorised low-impact connections set back from the beach to delineate the entrance to the public space and to clearly indicate the urbanisation boundary.\n\n\nThe construction programme for each segment will have to meet the needs of a broad range of users (including spaces for workers or tourists to change clothes and picnic and playgrounds for residents' children, et.).\n\n\n\n\nProgrammes

The programme lays down the linear development of walkways or non-motorised low-impact connections set back from the beach to delineate the entrance to the public space and to clearly indicate the urbanisation boundary.  The construction programme for each segment will have to meet the needs of a broad range of users (including spaces for workers or tourists to change clothes and picnic and playgrounds for residents' children, et.).",

Some 1.5m wide pedestrian easements could be accepted in very constrained sites or residential areas. \n\n\nTo provide continuity along the Waterfront, it will be connected to the surrounding road network and open spaces, if any. \n\n\nIf a residential road is planned by the sea, the pedestrian easement will be integrated into it (the road profile will have to be adapted). \n\n\nThe design of edges on both sides as well as on city side will avoid any \"walling off\" effect to favour a \"plug in\" design. \n\n\nThe pedestrian easement will be continuous between two contiguous projects in terms of width, surfacing, levelling. A financial contribution by riparian owners will enable the easement to be created and kept in good condition by the local authority. \n\n\n\n\nPedestrian easements accessible to the public should be developed whose width will vary according to the sites.

Embankments allowing access to the water (steps, etc.) will be favoured. \n\n\nDirect access points to water will be placed every 300m at the most. \n\n\nThe development of walkways very close to the water (low level walkways) will be favoured.

If a residential road is planned by the sea, the pedestrian easement will be integrated into it (the road profile will have to be adapted).   The design of edges on both sides as well as on city side will avoid any \"walling off\" effect to favour a \"plug in\" design.   The pedestrian easement will be continuous between two contiguous projects in terms of width, surfacing, levelling.

            "text": "Waterfront Guidelines\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nWhy asset guidelines?\n\n\nThe island country of Bahrain has a wealth of cultural, historical, landscape and ecological assets that distinguish it from other countries in the Middle East tourist value.\nA landscape policy must be drafted. To do so requires approach rooted in Bahrain\u2019s national identity and developing a shared vision of the country\u2019s landscape. This approach, targeting generally recognized assets, pursues three key successive courses of action:\nIdentify and protect most sensitive sites;\nPromote sites of interest;\nExpand by creating links between protected and promoted sites.\nThese courses of action will be launched from protected areas around which Special Planning Areas (SPA\u2019s) will be defined in the immediate or more distant vicinity. For each of these SPA s, dedicated guidelines will have to be respected. (Strategic Plan)\nThe asset guidelines comprise three sets of recommendations and best practices to be implemented close to protected areas, namely: Heritage Asset Guidelines, Waterfront Asset Guidelines and Green Asset Guidelines. These recommendations specific to each typology of assets complement the recommendations of the Project Guidelines, which apply to all major development projects, and the Public Waterfront guidelines, which apply to the public Waterfront.\n\n\nWhy Guidelines for the Waterfront?\n\n\nThe Waterfront is a major asset for Bahrain.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is an island whose relationship with the sea is of fundamental importance.\nShipbuilding, maritime trade and fishing have been the island\u2019s major historic lines of business. More recently, the EDB has identified tourism and leisure as being among the island\u2019s four key investment sectors. In terms of conservation and development, turning the Waterfront into a major Bahraini tourist attraction has become a priority.\nThe waterfront is a central area for the wellbeing of Bahrainis, GCC visitors and international tourists. It is an environment with:\nmarine valuable resources\na high urbanization and a concentration of major mobilities;\nmany Mega projects developed, underway or planned;\na wealth of cultural and heritage assets;\na diversity of landscapes.\nthe overarching goal of these guidelines is to make the Waterfront more resilient and reach sustainable development goals:\nSecure space for public use on Waterfront\nRestoring continuity and guarantee a public access to the coastline;\nFacilitate the access to the coastline : pedestrian, public transport, non-motorized modes;\nEnsure physical and visual connection to the waterfront through a specific landscape.\nFor the long-term enhancement of the coastline, it is necessary to protect its most fragile stretches. The following protected spaces must not be developed at all.\npublic beaches\nwild stretches of coastline\nmarine resources\nIn the following most valuable places, i.e. the Special Planning Areas (SPAs), development must be kept under control:\nbuilt-up areas\nbeach areas\nland reclamations.\nThe Waterfront Guidelines make a series of recommendations to developers and instructors involved in residential or mixed-use projects on how to preserve, enhance and develop the Bahraini coastline.\nThese recommendations do not apply to developers of strictly industrial or business projects.\n\n\nLes Special Planning Areas\n\n\n3 types de SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS waterfront sont \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper au regard de specific recommendations:\nin developed areas, the NLP designates a 300 meter wide strip where specific recommendations apply, il s\u2019agit des SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS (SPAs). On distingue 3 SPAs diff\u00e9rentes en fonction de leur localisation sur la c\u00f4te et leur destination.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt up Waterfront\n\n\nDans les areas urbanis\u00e9es, la National Land Policy identifie une bande de 300 m d\u2019\u00e9paisseur en partant du trait de c\u00f4te, dans laquelle un soin particulier sera apport\u00e9 aux d\u00e9veloppements pour en faire des espaces de vie, anim\u00e9s de jour comme de nuit toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e. L\u2019identit\u00e9 de chacune des s\u00e9quences du littoral urbain devra \u00eatre mise en valeur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaches Area\n\n\nThe development of spaces close to public beaches must highlight proximity to the sea and direct access to the water. Areas close to the beaches will be dedicated to leisure activities accessible to the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReclamations\n\n\nIn areas where developments in the sea are authorised by the Strategic Plan, they must pay particular attention to defining new identities, while limiting any impacts on the marine environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning principles\n\n\nGeneral principles\n\n\nEndowed with unique natural features (waterfront, palm groves) and a rich heritage, Bahrain is a uniquely pleasant place to live in and visit. Beyond their immediate objectives of helping to improve urban development, the Guidelines are inspired by the intent to emulate, enhance and adapt to modern days the practices that shaped successful human settlements by the inhabitants and visitors and to ensure sustainability over time. This aim concerns all the inhabitants\u2019 living spaces: i.e. the spaces they use to travel, to conduct their everyday professional activities, to share moments with their families every weekend, to locate their homes and design their layout, etc. To ensure the well-being of the inhabitants and visitors, the spaces they occupy and cross must meet three conditions. They must have:\n\n\n\u2605 A unique identity:\n\nBahrain features places on a human scale, well adapted to the local climate and uses, in a varied landscape in which it is easy to find your bearings. Bahrain\u2019s urban tradition, on which its uniqueness in the regional context is based, is the driver of its attractiveness, which needs to be sustained.\n\n\n\u2605 A healthy environment:\n\nPreserving the environment ensures the psychological well-being and physical good health of the inhabitants. To maintain the attractiveness of the Kingdom, it is necessary to limit the impact of human activities on the quality and temperature of the air, the quality of the ground and of the natural spaces, and to keep pollution levels low.\n\n\n\u2605 Sober developments:\n\nEnergy-efficient and sustainable developments will make the cost of living borne by the final users affordable and durable as soon as they invest. This comprehensive\nvision of a project\u2019s cost ensures that it gains in value: in fact, its attractiveness will be driven by good maintenance of spaces, buildings and infrastructures. These principles underpin the \u00abplace-making\u00bb method the Guidelines describe. They are applicable to all scales of project, from the largest involving entire parts of a town or city to the design and development of the smallest living spaces. From these basic values ensue the urban development principles and tools that make it possible to build communities that have the \u00abingredients of urbanity\u00bb, making cities successful and attractive.\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nIn order to produce the expected results in terms of economic and social benefits, the transformation of the Waterfront must be supported by a massive effort to enable as many people as possible to have access to it, enjoy it and benefit from the services provided.\n\n\nA coastline open to the public:\n the large-scale privatisation of the coastline in Bahrain has its limitations in terms of capitalising on its economic potential. Opening up the coastline to the public and deploying dense, mixed-use and attractive construction programmes hold out the prospect of much higher land rents and permanent sources of income (multiplication of property charges, revenue from commercial leases, revenue from temporary uses and public land concessions, etc.). Welcoming all kinds of visitors (national, from GCC countries, international) will increase the well-being of a much larger proportion of the population (see #sober developments).\n\n\nA developed coastline:\n the coastline accessible to the public should be developed in line with current and future uses. It should provide safe continuous space along the seafront for walking and other leisure activities in conditions sufficiently comfortable for a range of pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, etc. The construction programmes developed near the Waterfront will finance these developments (see #a unique identity).\n\nValue enhancement supported by the national mobility plan:\n the attractiveness of the seafront is to be supported by the national transport network. The intent is to make it easier for people to use means of transport other than cars such as: paths/links for non-motorised means of transport and public transport stops located close to the seafront, which provide easy access to leisure facilities and Waterfront construction programmes (see #a healthy environment).\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\nCoastline:\n the coastline is where the sea and the emerged land meet. This coastline moves according to the natural movements of the sand and the tides, especially in areas not artificially occupied.\nExclusion strip:\n this is a strip of land whose width varies from one * place to another. No construction work is allowed in this strip in order to maintain free access along the whole length of the coast. In places where the coastline moves, this exclusion strip protects its natural movements.\nPedestrian longitudinal easement:\n all new developments must allow pedestrians to enjoy a minimum amount of freedom of movement in the exclusion strip, so a footpath is included. It is in the form of a strip of land with a variable width, which is left construction-free and fence-free.\nPedestrian transversal easement:\n accessibility to the seafront from the hinterland is ensured by at least several low-impact links. Being perpendicular to the coastline, they provide regular access to the sea. They may consist of public paths or private paths open to the public.\nDiversity (mixed use)\n\n\nThe Guidelines advocate an increase in the diversity of functions, uses and building forms especially on the waterfront. This diversity, which is already part of Bahrain\u2019s urban waterfront tradition, has numerous benefits in terms of delivering needs-based, economically viable developments.\n\n\nEconomic equilibrium:\n the Guidelines propose to capitalise on the great financial dynamics of urban development on the waterfront, notably the dynamics generated by large-scale projects,. The variety of land uses, built environments and target customers and users makes it possible to develop a balanced portfolio of real estate products which commercialisation is less risky for developers. Such variety ensures proper end-to-end project development, qui participent \u00e0 l\u2019image du pays et \u00e0 son attractivit\u00e9. (#Sober developments)\n\n\nMultiple uses of public spaces:\n mixed uses made for lively public spaces both by day and by night, during working hours and weekends. This combination of timescales helps to save space and to identify lively and attractive places for residents and tourists alike. Sur le waterfront, ils constituent la vitrine de Bahre\u00efn dans le monde. (#A unique identity)\nReduced travel time: mixed uses and activities make it possible to concentrate several key functions in a single place, such as a restaurant close to a leisure area and to public transportation center. This enables the inhabitants to save time, energy and money by avoiding certain trips. It also reduces travel-related pollution. (#A healthy environment)\n\n\nRelated Keyword Definitions\nUrban programming: the identification, quantification and definition of the functions of a space in line with its ambition, identified needs, market conditions, and the project\u2019s economic feasibility as well as the spatial distribution of all these features.\nConsistency: the overall harmony and complementarity obtained by assembling together different entities (buildings, open space, public realm) in compliance with specific rules governing forms, volumes, materials, etc.\nMixed use: diversity of functions in a neighbourhood (e.g. integration of an urban centre featuring convenience stores and small restaurants) or in a building (e.g. integration of a shop on the ground floor of a small housing block).\nSafety and comfort:\n\n\nTo be attractive and lively, most coastal spaces are dedicated to non-motorised modes of mobility, particularly on foot. The public spaces allow the development of multiple uses: walking, picnicking, swimming, sports, etc. They provide opportunities for relaxing alone or in a group and for leisure activities and shopping. They are developed to ensure the comfort and safety of users throughout the day and the year.\n\n\nSimple and safe street and road crossings:\n the crossing of streets and roads by pedestrians is made easier. This makes it possible to enhance the modal share of non-motorised means of transport compared with the motor car, notably regarding daily journeys or leisure trips.\n\n\nDevelopments are focused on user needs:\n they take into account users\u2019 needs for shade, lighting, drinking water, urban furniture, etc. This makes public spaces attractive to a large section of the population. Trade and shopping flows also benefit from this.\n\n\nPleasant and protected walkways:\n simplifying and shortening pedestrian walkways and providing shaded footpaths help to develop low-impact modes of mobility. The Waterfront becomes the best place to transform the mobility strategy and become a showcase for low-impact, non-motorised modes of mobility.\n\n\nSense of place\n\n\nBahrain's urban and trading tradition started on the waterfront: its unique identity is still  visible in all its historic urban centres. This environment comprises specific urban and architectural forms structured around lively public spaces that allow many different activities to co-exist. Bahrain's originality must be sustained and reinvented to adapt to new users and the new aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\n\nRelated Keyword Definitions\nPublic realm:\n public space made up of roads and streets, but also open spaces, parks and gardens accessible to the public and which account for a large portion of unbuilt urban spaces. These interstitial spaces are used for travelling, leisure activities, exchanges, trade, etc. Their structure and design are adapted to local climate conditions and uses, enhance the inhabitants' quality of life and reinforce the identity of the places (sense of place).\nLandscape:\n it comprises the visual urban environment in all its forms - built up areas, unbuilt areas, planted spaces, topography, etc. These components contribute to our perception of a place, its beauty and its originality.\nPlanning intents\n\n\nProtect and preserve the waterfront:\nStabilize the coastline by allowing a variety of uses;\nPrevent environmental hazards (floods, landslide, etc.);\nPreserve natural and vulnerable areas from polluting human activities (cars, polluting industries, etc.).\nInvent a Waterfront sense of place:\nEnhance the waterfront landscape diversity;\nCreate an attractive public space adapted to the uses;\nEnhance transition spaces quality.\nReconnection and accessibility:\nEnsure an access to the sea for all;\nReconnect the waterfront and the city;\nFacilitate mobilities along the waterfront.\n\n\nFavour mixed-use development\n\n\nOn the whole, the coastal spaces are attractive in terms of the diversity of programmes and users, encompassing informal and economic uses (fishing, horse-riding, housing, hospitality, service sector activities, etc.). This ensures the vitality of the Waterfront all year round, by day and by night.\nThe principles laid down in this chapter are based on those laid down in the Project Guidelines.  \n\n\nGeneral Programming Principles\n\n\nA diversity of urban functions and construction programmes is planned along the coastline: their strategic importance is due to their being located on the coastline rather than in other parts of Bahrain.\nProgramming will alternate quiet coastline segments with livelier ones;\nRespect linear continuity featuring complementary centres of varying intensity.\n\n\nProgramming will endeavour to maintain existing activities, income generating or leisure, and ensure new development improves conditions and operations. To that purpose, consultation with existing users should be undertaken at the programming stage.\n\n\nSpecific Requirements for each perimetre\n\n\nExclusion strip\n\n\nAn unbuilt area made up of open spaces and light structures.\nNo building will be permitted, except for light, temporary structures.\nThe non-constructible area will be mainly dedicated to non-motorised low-impact modes of mobility and to open spaces.\nThe programme will include visitor information facilities.\n\n\nSeafront\n\n\nThis area corresponds to the first built frontage and to the exits of the perpendicular access ways to the sea.\nThe programme will sustain or enhance pre-existing uses, be they leisure (swimming, horse-riding) or economic (fishing, arts and crafts).\nLand uses that impose restrictions on access will be prohibited in order to ensure public access to the beach and easements for pedestrian access (resorts, compounds, etc.).\nThe programming of activities relating directly to the Waterfront will evolve over time (temporary use/occupation of vacant lots, etc.).\nResidential land uses will be balanced between locals, expats and tourists.\nThe hotel construction programmes will favour structures that respect the natural environment and landscape, and which complement the existing hotel offering.\nParking lots will not be visible on the seafront. Their preferred location will be landside.\nSeafront facilities that meet the needs of local residents shall be accessible for both residents and visitors. It will be given the possibility of derogating from the maximum authorised distances between them;\n\n\nLandside\n\n\nfavour services and facilities that meet the needs of residents, economically active people and visitors to foster a diversity of users.\nProjects that do not feature continuity with an existing urban fabric will have to be particularly autonomous from an employment point of view (with an Employment Concentration Indicator of between 0.6 and 1);\ndynamic hubs will be located at the interface between tourist areas and neighbouring living quarters. They will be easily accessible from the seafront;\nDevelopments located near the Waterfront will have to set their supply of parking spaces back from the seafront\n\n\nSpecific Requirements per SPA\n\n\n...\n\n\nProgrammes recommended and to be avoided:\n\n\n...\n\n\nAssessment tools\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument required\n\n\nContent\n\n\nWhy is it required?\n\n\nWhat is to be assessed?\n\n\nAssessment criteria\n\n\nAdvice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject outline\n\n\nDevelopment presentation, objectives and targeted population\n\n\nIn order to benefit the neighbourhood and the city as a whole, the project's aims must be aligned with the national, environmental, cultural and tourist strategy for the sector in which it is located.\n\n\n-the project's image and identity must match-it must be adequately ambitious-The anticipated number of users (tourists and inhabitants) must take into account the fragility of the site.\n\n\n-The proposed programmes should enhance the site-The proposed programmes must be opened to the public-The proposed programmes must include existing usages-Asset classes on offer should be diversified and adapted to targeted market segments-The proposed density should be in line with the strategy.\n\n\nA meeting should be held with the authorities concerned prior to the implementation of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket study\n\n\nSee \nMega project\n and \nMajor Subdivision\n Manuals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand use schedule (comprehensive and detailed for each land use)\n\n\nContent of the project and detailed content of each program: -Land area-Built-up area-FAR and density\n\n\nThe project's impact on its environment must be assessed; its benefits must be real (functional mixed use, density, etc.); and its possible negative impact must be mitigated.

Landing stages for boat shuttles (water taxis) will be available every 500m in dense urban areas.\n\n\nEffective integration of heavy infrastructures\n\n\nSeaside roads with heavy traffic (Distributor roads and above) will be turned into peaceful urban boulevards thanks to speed limits, traffic lights, suitably dimensioned roads, public transport lanes, wide sidewalks and street-level (ground floor) retail outlets, etc.\nLocal roads will optimize the functioning of services related to tourism and ports. Their integration into the immediate environment will be studied to avoid visual and physical barriers;\nThe presence of heavy infrastructures (highways, utility corridors, elevated transport lines, etc) along the coast will be avoided as much as possible on the water's edge. Otherwise, the following principles will apply:\nThey will be well-integrated into their environment to avoid visual and physical barriers.\nTheir impact will be limited thanks to devices such as plantations and the permeability and porosity characteristics of materials for ground cover.\nTheir presence will be offset by the development of:\nAdjacent protected walkways for non-motorised mobility\nOpen and/or natural spaces developed onsite or elsewhere\nThe positioning of regular crossings (see 3.2)\n\n\nStage the waterfront\n\n\nReveal the coastal and seaboard landscape\n\n\nThe various schemes proposed here enable people to feel the presence of the seafront on different scales, reminding them of the insular nature of the Kingdom's identity.\n\n\nImprove the perception of the sea from the coast and the adjacent neighbourhoods\n\n\nDepending on each site's geographical context (heights, contours, etc.) it is necessary to preserve the existing views of the sea and to plan extra vistas;\nPoints of interest will be highlighted by developing vantage points (belvederes, etc.):\nwherever the shape of the coast is suitable (capes, etc.);\nwherever facing remarkable coastal landscape (islands, urban or port skylines, etc.);\nSet the hierarchy of views in accordance with the requirements of the developments.\n\n\nCreate a remarkable \"coastal landscape\"\n\n\nThe planning of seafront built and non-built forms helps to create a coastal landscape visible from the sea and the coastline facing each other;\nThe diversity of built forms should ensure avoidance of monotonous urban frontage and the emergence of a remarkable skyline;\nPlanners will seek to find the appropriate seaboard sequences to highlight unique places and extend the range of uses;\nThese sequences will leverage existing landmarks such as the natural heritage or historic monuments or even new future landmarks such as public space facilities (structures designed to command fine views, art installations, lighting, etc.);\nThe streetscapes and built forms shall be consistent with the landscaping strategy and well integrated into landscaped corridors or facing remarkable vistas.\n\f\n\n\nInvent a waterfront sense of place\n\n\nAttractive and comfortable public spaces\n\n\nIn addition to the recommendations given in Part 3, the coastal promenade will be shaded (30% of the linear length) and provide drinking water supply points at regular intervals (every 300m);\nDevelopments will be accessible to persons with reduced mobility.\nThe comfort of pedestrians' and a variety of user walkways and promenades will be enhanced thanks to shading and cooling features:\nshade houses, vegetation, arcades;\nthe use of materials that reduce noise and heat;\nlighting\nkeeping sources of heat at a distance (A/C emissions, cars parked with engines running, etc.);\nThe technical properties of materials for pavements and ground cover shall ensure maximum noise reduction and mitigation of the effects of heat.\nPublic spaces shall be serviced by transport facilities (public transport, parking lots, etc.); this recommendation shall apply as a priority to coastal promenades and access corridors;\nMaterials and furniture shall facilitate legibility.\n\n\nBoundaries that enhance the quality of the landscape\n\n\nThe first alignment of buildings will benefit from the view onto the sea while preserving a sufficient degree of privacy;\nThe privacy of residential developments will be treated by other means than blind walls (forbidden): inclines, light shafts, depth of plantations, etc.\nSetbacks and unbuilt parts of plots will be sufficiently wide to be usable (for gardens, patios, etc.) and will preferably be planted;\nIf the coastal promenade (pedestrian longitudinal easement) is located right in front of the first line of buildings, an exclusion strip at least two meters wide will be respected and preferably planted.\n\n\nAdapt built forms\n\n\nCreate a coastal urban front\n\n\nFor mega projects, this means defining architectural sequences that are relevant to land and coastal uses. Height variations will create a dynamic waterfront, displaying various views /images;\nAll waterfront developments should feature both seaside and landside fa\u00e7ades. If the main fa\u00e7ade is seaside, the other fa\u00e7ade will be treated with the same care. Blind facades are forbidden on the seaside and shall be avoided;\nThe architecture of the buildings facing the sea will take advantage of this situation with openings, balconies, loggias, etc;\nTechnical structures of all kinds (reservoirs, AC, aerials, displays, etc.) will have to be integrated into the fa\u00e7ades and the roofs;\nElectricity substations will be incorporated into the buildings. They will not be placed on the seafront or in the visual fields of the transversal corridors.

Beyond their immediate objectives of helping to improve urban development, the Guidelines are inspired by the intent to emulate, enhance and adapt to modern days the practices that shaped successful human settlements by the inhabitants and visitors and to ensure sustainability over time. This aim concerns all the inhabitants\u2019 living spaces: i.e. the spaces they use to travel, to conduct their everyday professional activities, to share moments with their families every weekend, to locate their homes and design their layout, etc. To ensure the well-being of the inhabitants and visitors, the spaces they occupy and cross must meet three conditions. They must have:  \u2605 A unique identity: \nBahrain features places on a human scale, well adapted to the local climate and uses, in a varied landscape in which it is easy to find your bearings. Bahrain\u2019s urban tradition, on which its uniqueness in the regional context is based, is the driver of its attractiveness, which needs to be sustained.  \u2605 A healthy environment: \nPreserving the environment ensures the psychological well-being and physical good health of the inhabitants. To maintain the attractiveness of the Kingdom, it is necessary to limit the impact of human activities on the quality and temperature of the air, the quality of the ground and of the natural spaces, and to keep pollution levels low.  \u2605 Sober developments: \nEnergy-efficient and sustainable developments will make the cost of living borne by the final users affordable and durable as soon as they invest. This comprehensive\nvision of a project\u2019s cost ensures that it gains in value: in fact, its attractiveness will be driven by good maintenance of spaces, buildings and infrastructures. These principles underpin the \u00abplace-making\u00bb method the Guidelines describe. They are applicable to all scales of project, from the largest involving entire parts of a town or city to the design and development of the smallest living spaces.

A coastline open to the public:  the large-scale privatisation of the coastline in Bahrain has its limitations in terms of capitalising on its economic potential. Opening up the coastline to the public and deploying dense, mixed-use and attractive construction programmes hold out the prospect of much higher land rents and permanent sources of income (multiplication of property charges, revenue from commercial leases, revenue from temporary uses and public land concessions, etc.). Welcoming all kinds of visitors (national, from GCC countries, international) will increase the well-being of a much larger proportion of the population (see #sober developments).  A developed coastline:  the coastline accessible to the public should be developed in line with current and future uses. It should provide safe continuous space along the seafront for walking and other leisure activities in conditions sufficiently comfortable for a range of pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, etc. The construction programmes developed near the Waterfront will finance these developments (see #a unique identity). Value enhancement supported by the national mobility plan:  the attractiveness of the seafront is to be supported by the national transport network. The intent is to make it easier for people to use means of transport other than cars such as: paths/links for non-motorised means of transport and public transport stops located close to the seafront, which provide easy access to leisure facilities and Waterfront construction programmes (see #a healthy environment).   Keywords Coastline:  the coastline is where the sea and the emerged land meet. This coastline moves according to the natural movements of the sand and the tides, especially in areas not artificially occupied.

No construction work is allowed in this strip in order to maintain free access along the whole length of the coast. In places where the coastline moves, this exclusion strip protects its natural movements. Pedestrian longitudinal easement:  all new developments must allow pedestrians to enjoy a minimum amount of freedom of movement in the exclusion strip, so a footpath is included. It is in the form of a strip of land with a variable width, which is left construction-free and fence-free. Pedestrian transversal easement:  accessibility to the seafront from the hinterland is ensured by at least several low-impact links.

            "text": "Waterfront Guidelines\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nWhy asset guidelines?\n\n\nThe island country of Bahrain has a wealth of cultural, historical, landscape and ecological assets that distinguish it from other countries in the Middle East tourist value.\nA landscape policy must be drafted. To do so requires approach rooted in Bahrain\u2019s national identity and developing a shared vision of the country\u2019s landscape. This approach, targeting generally recognized assets, pursues three key successive courses of action:\nIdentify and protect most sensitive sites;\nPromote sites of interest;\nExpand by creating links between protected and promoted sites.\nThese courses of action will be launched from protected areas around which Special Planning Areas (SPA\u2019s) will be defined in the immediate or more distant vicinity. For each of these SPA s, dedicated guidelines will have to be respected. (Strategic Plan)\nThe asset guidelines comprise three sets of recommendations and best practices to be implemented close to protected areas, namely: Heritage Asset Guidelines, Waterfront Asset Guidelines and Green Asset Guidelines. These recommendations specific to each typology of assets complement the recommendations of the Project Guidelines, which apply to all major development projects, and the Public Waterfront guidelines, which apply to the public Waterfront.\n\n\nWhy Guidelines for the Waterfront?\n\n\nThe Waterfront is a major asset for Bahrain.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is an island whose relationship with the sea is of fundamental importance.\nShipbuilding, maritime trade and fishing have been the island\u2019s major historic lines of business. More recently, the EDB has identified tourism and leisure as being among the island\u2019s four key investment sectors. In terms of conservation and development, turning the Waterfront into a major Bahraini tourist attraction has become a priority.\nThe waterfront is a central area for the wellbeing of Bahrainis, GCC visitors and international tourists. It is an environment with:\nmarine valuable resources\na high urbanization and a concentration of major mobilities;\nmany Mega projects developed, underway or planned;\na wealth of cultural and heritage assets;\na diversity of landscapes.\nthe overarching goal of these guidelines is to make the Waterfront more resilient and reach sustainable development goals:\nSecure space for public use on Waterfront\nRestoring continuity and guarantee a public access to the coastline;\nFacilitate the access to the coastline : pedestrian, public transport, non-motorized modes;\nEnsure physical and visual connection to the waterfront through a specific landscape.\nFor the long-term enhancement of the coastline, it is necessary to protect its most fragile stretches. The following protected spaces must not be developed at all.\npublic beaches\nwild stretches of coastline\nmarine resources\nIn the following most valuable places, i.e. the Special Planning Areas (SPAs), development must be kept under control:\nbuilt-up areas\nbeach areas\nland reclamations.\nThe Waterfront Guidelines make a series of recommendations to developers and instructors involved in residential or mixed-use projects on how to preserve, enhance and develop the Bahraini coastline.\nThese recommendations do not apply to developers of strictly industrial or business projects.\n\n\nLes Special Planning Areas\n\n\n3 types de SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS waterfront sont \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper au regard de specific recommendations:\nin developed areas, the NLP designates a 300 meter wide strip where specific recommendations apply, il s\u2019agit des SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS (SPAs). On distingue 3 SPAs diff\u00e9rentes en fonction de leur localisation sur la c\u00f4te et leur destination.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt up Waterfront\n\n\nDans les areas urbanis\u00e9es, la National Land Policy identifie une bande de 300 m d\u2019\u00e9paisseur en partant du trait de c\u00f4te, dans laquelle un soin particulier sera apport\u00e9 aux d\u00e9veloppements pour en faire des espaces de vie, anim\u00e9s de jour comme de nuit toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e. L\u2019identit\u00e9 de chacune des s\u00e9quences du littoral urbain devra \u00eatre mise en valeur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeaches Area\n\n\nThe development of spaces close to public beaches must highlight proximity to the sea and direct access to the water. Areas close to the beaches will be dedicated to leisure activities accessible to the general public.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReclamations\n\n\nIn areas where developments in the sea are authorised by the Strategic Plan, they must pay particular attention to defining new identities, while limiting any impacts on the marine environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlanning principles\n\n\nGeneral principles\n\n\nEndowed with unique natural features (waterfront, palm groves) and a rich heritage, Bahrain is a uniquely pleasant place to live in and visit. Beyond their immediate objectives of helping to improve urban development, the Guidelines are inspired by the intent to emulate, enhance and adapt to modern days the practices that shaped successful human settlements by the inhabitants and visitors and to ensure sustainability over time. This aim concerns all the inhabitants\u2019 living spaces: i.e. the spaces they use to travel, to conduct their everyday professional activities, to share moments with their families every weekend, to locate their homes and design their layout, etc. To ensure the well-being of the inhabitants and visitors, the spaces they occupy and cross must meet three conditions. They must have:\n\n\n\u2605 A unique identity:\n\nBahrain features places on a human scale, well adapted to the local climate and uses, in a varied landscape in which it is easy to find your bearings. Bahrain\u2019s urban tradition, on which its uniqueness in the regional context is based, is the driver of its attractiveness, which needs to be sustained.\n\n\n\u2605 A healthy environment:\n\nPreserving the environment ensures the psychological well-being and physical good health of the inhabitants. To maintain the attractiveness of the Kingdom, it is necessary to limit the impact of human activities on the quality and temperature of the air, the quality of the ground and of the natural spaces, and to keep pollution levels low.\n\n\n\u2605 Sober developments:\n\nEnergy-efficient and sustainable developments will make the cost of living borne by the final users affordable and durable as soon as they invest. This comprehensive\nvision of a project\u2019s cost ensures that it gains in value: in fact, its attractiveness will be driven by good maintenance of spaces, buildings and infrastructures. These principles underpin the \u00abplace-making\u00bb method the Guidelines describe. They are applicable to all scales of project, from the largest involving entire parts of a town or city to the design and development of the smallest living spaces. From these basic values ensue the urban development principles and tools that make it possible to build communities that have the \u00abingredients of urbanity\u00bb, making cities successful and attractive.\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\nIn order to produce the expected results in terms of economic and social benefits, the transformation of the Waterfront must be supported by a massive effort to enable as many people as possible to have access to it, enjoy it and benefit from the services provided.\n\n\nA coastline open to the public:\n the large-scale privatisation of the coastline in Bahrain has its limitations in terms of capitalising on its economic potential. Opening up the coastline to the public and deploying dense, mixed-use and attractive construction programmes hold out the prospect of much higher land rents and permanent sources of income (multiplication of property charges, revenue from commercial leases, revenue from temporary uses and public land concessions, etc.). Welcoming all kinds of visitors (national, from GCC countries, international) will increase the well-being of a much larger proportion of the population (see #sober developments).\n\n\nA developed coastline:\n the coastline accessible to the public should be developed in line with current and future uses. It should provide safe continuous space along the seafront for walking and other leisure activities in conditions sufficiently comfortable for a range of pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, etc. The construction programmes developed near the Waterfront will finance these developments (see #a unique identity).\n\nValue enhancement supported by the national mobility plan:\n the attractiveness of the seafront is to be supported by the national transport network. The intent is to make it easier for people to use means of transport other than cars such as: paths/links for non-motorised means of transport and public transport stops located close to the seafront, which provide easy access to leisure facilities and Waterfront construction programmes (see #a healthy environment).\n\n\n\n\nKeywords\nCoastline:\n the coastline is where the sea and the emerged land meet. This coastline moves according to the natural movements of the sand and the tides, especially in areas not artificially occupied.\nExclusion strip:\n this is a strip of land whose width varies from one * place to another. No construction work is allowed in this strip in order to maintain free access along the whole length of the coast. In places where the coastline moves, this exclusion strip protects its natural movements.\nPedestrian longitudinal easement:\n all new developments must allow pedestrians to enjoy a minimum amount of freedom of movement in the exclusion strip, so a footpath is included. It is in the form of a strip of land with a variable width, which is left construction-free and fence-free.\nPedestrian transversal easement:\n accessibility to the seafront from the hinterland is ensured by at least several low-impact links. Being perpendicular to the coastline, they provide regular access to the sea. They may consist of public paths or private paths open to the public.\nDiversity (mixed use)\n\n\nThe Guidelines advocate an increase in the diversity of functions, uses and building forms especially on the waterfront. This diversity, which is already part of Bahrain\u2019s urban waterfront tradition, has numerous benefits in terms of delivering needs-based, economically viable developments.\n\n\nEconomic equilibrium:\n the Guidelines propose to capitalise on the great financial dynamics of urban development on the waterfront, notably the dynamics generated by large-scale projects,. The variety of land uses, built environments and target customers and users makes it possible to develop a balanced portfolio of real estate products which commercialisation is less risky for developers. Such variety ensures proper end-to-end project development, qui participent \u00e0 l\u2019image du pays et \u00e0 son attractivit\u00e9. (#Sober developments)\n\n\nMultiple uses of public spaces:\n mixed uses made for lively public spaces both by day and by night, during working hours and weekends. This combination of timescales helps to save space and to identify lively and attractive places for residents and tourists alike. Sur le waterfront, ils constituent la vitrine de Bahre\u00efn dans le monde. (#A unique identity)\nReduced travel time: mixed uses and activities make it possible to concentrate several key functions in a single place, such as a restaurant close to a leisure area and to public transportation center. This enables the inhabitants to save time, energy and money by avoiding certain trips. It also reduces travel-related pollution. (#A healthy environment)\n\n\nRelated Keyword Definitions\nUrban programming: the identification, quantification and definition of the functions of a space in line with its ambition, identified needs, market conditions, and the project\u2019s economic feasibility as well as the spatial distribution of all these features.\nConsistency: the overall harmony and complementarity obtained by assembling together different entities (buildings, open space, public realm) in compliance with specific rules governing forms, volumes, materials, etc.\nMixed use: diversity of functions in a neighbourhood (e.g. integration of an urban centre featuring convenience stores and small restaurants) or in a building (e.g. integration of a shop on the ground floor of a small housing block).\nSafety and comfort:\n\n\nTo be attractive and lively, most coastal spaces are dedicated to non-motorised modes of mobility, particularly on foot. The public spaces allow the development of multiple uses: walking, picnicking, swimming, sports, etc. They provide opportunities for relaxing alone or in a group and for leisure activities and shopping. They are developed to ensure the comfort and safety of users throughout the day and the year.\n\n\nSimple and safe street and road crossings:\n the crossing of streets and roads by pedestrians is made easier. This makes it possible to enhance the modal share of non-motorised means of transport compared with the motor car, notably regarding daily journeys or leisure trips.\n\n\nDevelopments are focused on user needs:\n they take into account users\u2019 needs for shade, lighting, drinking water, urban furniture, etc. This makes public spaces attractive to a large section of the population. Trade and shopping flows also benefit from this.\n\n\nPleasant and protected walkways:\n simplifying and shortening pedestrian walkways and providing shaded footpaths help to develop low-impact modes of mobility. The Waterfront becomes the best place to transform the mobility strategy and become a showcase for low-impact, non-motorised modes of mobility.\n\n\nSense of place\n\n\nBahrain's urban and trading tradition started on the waterfront: its unique identity is still  visible in all its historic urban centres.

Bahrain's originality must be sustained and reinvented to adapt to new users and the new aspirations of its inhabitants.\n\n\nRelated Keyword Definitions\nPublic realm:\n public space made up of roads and streets, but also open spaces, parks and gardens accessible to the public and which account for a large portion of unbuilt urban spaces. These interstitial spaces are used for travelling, leisure activities, exchanges, trade, etc. Their structure and design are adapted to local climate conditions and uses, enhance the inhabitants' quality of life and reinforce the identity of the places (sense of place).\nLandscape:\n it comprises the visual urban environment in all its forms - built up areas, unbuilt areas, planted spaces, topography, etc. These components contribute to our perception of a place, its beauty and its originality.\nPlanning intents\n\n\nProtect and preserve the waterfront:\nStabilize the coastline by allowing a variety of uses;\nPrevent environmental hazards (floods, landslide, etc.);\nPreserve natural and vulnerable areas from polluting human activities (cars, polluting industries, etc.).\nInvent a Waterfront sense of place:\nEnhance the waterfront landscape diversity;\nCreate an attractive public space adapted to the uses;\nEnhance transition spaces quality.\nReconnection and accessibility:\nEnsure an access to the sea for all;\nReconnect the waterfront and the city;\nFacilitate mobilities along the waterfront.\n\n\nFavour mixed-use development\n\n\nOn the whole, the coastal spaces are attractive in terms of the diversity of programmes and users, encompassing informal and economic uses (fishing, horse-riding, housing, hospitality, service sector activities, etc.).

To that purpose, consultation with existing users should be undertaken at the programming stage.\n\n\nSpecific Requirements for each perimetre\n\n\nExclusion strip\n\n\nAn unbuilt area made up of open spaces and light structures.\nNo building will be permitted, except for light, temporary structures.\nThe non-constructible area will be mainly dedicated to non-motorised low-impact modes of mobility and to open spaces.\nThe programme will include visitor information facilities.\n\n\nSeafront\n\n\nThis area corresponds to the first built frontage and to the exits of the perpendicular access ways to the sea.\nThe programme will sustain or enhance pre-existing uses, be they leisure (swimming, horse-riding) or economic (fishing, arts and crafts).\nLand uses that impose restrictions on access will be prohibited in order to ensure public access to the beach and easements for pedestrian access (resorts, compounds, etc.).\nThe programming of activities relating directly to the Waterfront will evolve over time (temporary use/occupation of vacant lots, etc.).\nResidential land uses will be balanced between locals, expats and tourists.\nThe hotel construction programmes will favour structures that respect the natural environment and landscape, and which complement the existing hotel offering.\nParking lots will not be visible on the seafront. Their preferred location will be landside.\nSeafront facilities that meet the needs of local residents shall be accessible for both residents and visitors. It will be given the possibility of derogating from the maximum authorised distances between them;\n\n\nLandside\n\n\nfavour services and facilities that meet the needs of residents, economically active people and visitors to foster a diversity of users.\nProjects that do not feature continuity with an existing urban fabric will have to be particularly autonomous from an employment point of view (with an Employment Concentration Indicator of between 0.6 and 1);\ndynamic hubs will be located at the interface between tourist areas and neighbouring living quarters.

Beyond their immediate objectives of helping to improve urban development, the Guidelines are inspired by the intent to emulate, enhance and adapt to modern days the practices that shaped successful human settlements by the inhabitants and visitors and to ensure sustainability over time. This aim concerns all the inhabitants\u2019 living spaces: i.e. the spaces they use to travel, to conduct their everyday professional activities, to share moments with their families every weekend, to locate their homes and design their layout, etc. To ensure the well-being of the inhabitants and visitors, the spaces they occupy and cross must meet three conditions. They must have:  \u2605 A unique identity: \nBahrain features places on a human scale, well adapted to the local climate and uses, in a varied landscape in which it is easy to find your bearings. Bahrain\u2019s urban tradition, on which its uniqueness in the regional context is based, is the driver of its attractiveness, which needs to be sustained.  \u2605 A healthy environment: \nPreserving the environment ensures the psychological well-being and physical good health of the inhabitants. To maintain the attractiveness of the Kingdom, it is necessary to limit the impact of human activities on the quality and temperature of the air, the quality of the ground and of the natural spaces, and to keep pollution levels low.  \u2605 Sober developments: \nEnergy-efficient and sustainable developments will make the cost of living borne by the final users affordable and durable as soon as they invest. This comprehensive\nvision of a project\u2019s cost ensures that it gains in value: in fact, its attractiveness will be driven by good maintenance of spaces, buildings and infrastructures. These principles underpin the \u00abplace-making\u00bb method the Guidelines describe. They are applicable to all scales of project, from the largest involving entire parts of a town or city to the design and development of the smallest living spaces.

A coastline open to the public:  the large-scale privatisation of the coastline in Bahrain has its limitations in terms of capitalising on its economic potential. Opening up the coastline to the public and deploying dense, mixed-use and attractive construction programmes hold out the prospect of much higher land rents and permanent sources of income (multiplication of property charges, revenue from commercial leases, revenue from temporary uses and public land concessions, etc.). Welcoming all kinds of visitors (national, from GCC countries, international) will increase the well-being of a much larger proportion of the population (see #sober developments).  A developed coastline:  the coastline accessible to the public should be developed in line with current and future uses. It should provide safe continuous space along the seafront for walking and other leisure activities in conditions sufficiently comfortable for a range of pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, etc. The construction programmes developed near the Waterfront will finance these developments (see #a unique identity). Value enhancement supported by the national mobility plan:  the attractiveness of the seafront is to be supported by the national transport network. The intent is to make it easier for people to use means of transport other than cars such as: paths/links for non-motorised means of transport and public transport stops located close to the seafront, which provide easy access to leisure facilities and Waterfront construction programmes (see #a healthy environment).   Keywords Coastline:  the coastline is where the sea and the emerged land meet. This coastline moves according to the natural movements of the sand and the tides, especially in areas not artificially occupied. Exclusion strip:  this is a strip of land whose width varies from one * place to another. No construction work is allowed in this strip in order to maintain free access along the whole length of the coast. In places where the coastline moves, this exclusion strip protects its natural movements. Pedestrian longitudinal easement:  all new developments must allow pedestrians to enjoy a minimum amount of freedom of movement in the exclusion strip, so a footpath is included. It is in the form of a strip of land with a variable width, which is left construction-free and fence-free. Pedestrian transversal easement:  accessibility to the seafront from the hinterland is ensured by at least several low-impact links.

This has contributed to the development of retail and leisure support facilities.  http://www.chapmantaylor.com/projects/liverpool-waters\nhttp://ch.visitliverpool.com/imageresizer/?image=%2Fdmsimgs%2FThe_Albert_Dock_3_1042351086.png&action=ProductDetail\nhttp://www.chapmantaylor.com/uploads/Chapman_Taylor_433_LCDM_Liverpool_Waters_Liverpool_UK_N51_medium.jpg  BEach AREAS\nFOCUS : CONEY ISLAND BEACH, Brooklyn, US  On Coney Island Beach, a wide walkway has been laid out which is punctuated with restaurants and shops. It helps to push the urban frontage back by at least 25 metres and to preserve a wide linear public pathway, which is regularly used by sports practitioners and for holding events.\nhttps://lonelyplanetwpnews.imgix.net/2017/04/GettyImages-518852628.jpg",
