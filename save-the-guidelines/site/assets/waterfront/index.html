<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<h3 id="why-asset-guidelines">Why asset guidelines?</h3>
<p>The island country of Bahrain has a wealth of cultural, historical, landscape and ecological assets that distinguish it from other countries in the Middle East tourist value.
A landscape policy must be drafted. To do so requires approach rooted in Bahrain’s national identity and developing a shared vision of the country’s landscape. This approach, targeting generally recognized assets, pursues three key successive courses of action:
Identify and protect most sensitive sites;
Promote sites of interest;
Expand by creating links between protected and promoted sites.
These courses of action will be launched from protected areas around which Special Planning Areas (SPA’s) will be defined in the immediate or more distant vicinity. For each of these SPA s, dedicated guidelines will have to be respected. (Strategic Plan)
The asset guidelines comprise three sets of recommendations and best practices to be implemented close to protected areas, namely: Heritage Asset Guidelines, Waterfront Asset Guidelines and Green Asset Guidelines. These recommendations specific to each typology of assets complement the recommendations of the Project Guidelines, which apply to all major development projects, and the Public Waterfront guidelines, which apply to the public Waterfront.</p>
<h2 id="why-guidelines-for-the-waterfront">Why Guidelines for the Waterfront?</h2>
<p>The Waterfront is a major asset for Bahrain.
The Kingdom of Bahrain is an island whose relationship with the sea is of fundamental importance.
Shipbuilding, maritime trade and fishing have been the island’s major historic lines of business. More recently, the EDB has identified tourism and leisure as being among the island’s four key investment sectors. In terms of conservation and development, turning the Waterfront into a major Bahraini tourist attraction has become a priority.
The waterfront is a central area for the wellbeing of Bahrainis, GCC visitors and international tourists. It is an environment with:
marine valuable resources
a high urbanization and a concentration of major mobilities;
many Mega projects developed, underway or planned;
a wealth of cultural and heritage assets;
a diversity of landscapes.
the overarching goal of these guidelines is to make the Waterfront more resilient and reach sustainable development goals:
Secure space for public use on Waterfront
Restoring continuity and guarantee a public access to the coastline;
Facilitate the access to the coastline : pedestrian, public transport, non-motorized modes;
Ensure physical and visual connection to the waterfront through a specific landscape.
For the long-term enhancement of the coastline, it is necessary to protect its most fragile stretches. The following protected spaces must not be developed at all.
public beaches
wild stretches of coastline
marine resources
In the following most valuable places, i.e. the Special Planning Areas (SPAs), development must be kept under control:
built-up areas
beach areas
land reclamations.
The Waterfront Guidelines make a series of recommendations to developers and instructors involved in residential or mixed-use projects on how to preserve, enhance and develop the Bahraini coastline.
These recommendations do not apply to developers of strictly industrial or business projects.</p>
<h3 id="les-special-planning-areas">Les Special Planning Areas</h3>
<p>3 types de SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS waterfront sont à développer au regard de specific recommendations:
in developed areas, the NLP designates a 300 meter wide strip where specific recommendations apply, il s’agit des SPECIAL PLANNING AREAS (SPAs). On distingue 3 SPAs différentes en fonction de leur localisation sur la côte et leur destination.</p>

<h3 id="planning-principles">Planning principles</h3>
<h4 id="general-principles">General principles</h4>
<p>Endowed with unique natural features (waterfront, palm groves) and a rich heritage, Bahrain is a uniquely pleasant place to live in and visit. Beyond their immediate objectives of helping to improve urban development, the Guidelines are inspired by the intent to emulate, enhance and adapt to modern days the practices that shaped successful human settlements by the inhabitants and visitors and to ensure sustainability over time. This aim concerns all the inhabitants’ living spaces: i.e. the spaces they use to travel, to conduct their everyday professional activities, to share moments with their families every weekend, to locate their homes and design their layout, etc. To ensure the well-being of the inhabitants and visitors, the spaces they occupy and cross must meet three conditions. They must have:
- A unique identity:
Bahrain features places on a human scale, well adapted to the local climate and uses, in a varied landscape in which it is easy to find your bearings. Bahrain’s urban tradition, on which its uniqueness in the regional context is based, is the driver of its attractiveness, which needs to be sustained.
- A healthy environment:
Preserving the environment ensures the psychological well-being and physical good health of the inhabitants. To maintain the attractiveness of the Kingdom, it is necessary to limit the impact of human activities on the quality and temperature of the air, the quality of the ground and of the natural spaces, and to keep pollution levels low.
-  Sober developments:
Energy-efficient and sustainable developments will make the cost of living borne by the final users affordable and durable as soon as they invest. This comprehensive
vision of a project’s cost ensures that it gains in value: in fact, its attractiveness will be driven by good maintenance of spaces, buildings and infrastructures. These principles underpin the «place-making» method the Guidelines describe. They are applicable to all scales of project, from the largest involving entire parts of a town or city to the design and development of the smallest living spaces. From these basic values ensue the urban development principles and tools that make it possible to build communities that have the «ingredients of urbanity», making cities successful and attractive.</p>
<p>Accessibility
In order to produce the expected results in terms of economic and social benefits, the transformation of the Waterfront must be supported by a massive effort to enable as many people as possible to have access to it, enjoy it and benefit from the services provided.
A coastline open to the public: the large-scale privatisation of the coastline in Bahrain has its limitations in terms of capitalising on its economic potential. Opening up the coastline to the public and deploying dense, mixed-use and attractive construction programmes hold out the prospect of much higher land rents and permanent sources of income (multiplication of property charges, revenue from commercial leases, revenue from temporary uses and public land concessions, etc.). Welcoming all kinds of visitors (national, from GCC countries, international) will increase the well-being of a much larger proportion of the population (see #sober developments).
A developed coastline: the coastline accessible to the public should be developed in line with current and future uses. It should provide safe continuous space along the seafront for walking and other leisure activities in conditions sufficiently comfortable for a range of pedestrians, joggers, cyclists, etc. The construction programmes developed near the Waterfront will finance these developments (see #a unique identity).
Value enhancement supported by the national mobility plan: the attractiveness of the seafront is to be supported by the national transport network. The intent is to make it easier for people to use means of transport other than cars such as: paths/links for non-motorised means of transport and public transport stops located close to the seafront, which provide easy access to leisure facilities and Waterfront construction programmes (see #a healthy environment).
Keywords:
Coastline: the coastline is where the sea and the emerged land meet. This coastline moves according to the natural movements of the sand and the tides, especially in areas not artificially occupied.
Exclusion strip: this is a strip of land whose width varies from one place to another. No construction work is allowed in this strip in order to maintain free access along the whole length of the coast. In places where the coastline moves, this exclusion strip protects its natural movements.
Pedestrian longitudinal easement: all new developments must allow pedestrians to enjoy a minimum amount of freedom of movement in the exclusion strip, so a footpath is included. It is in the form of a strip of land with a variable width, which is left construction-free and fence-free.
Pedestrian transversal easement: accessibility to the seafront from the hinterland is ensured by at least several low-impact links. Being perpendicular to the coastline, they provide regular access to the sea. They may consist of public paths or private paths open to the public.
Diversity (mixed use)
The Guidelines advocate an increase in the diversity of functions, uses and building forms especially on the waterfront. This diversity, which is already part of Bahrain’s urban waterfront tradition, has numerous benefits in terms of delivering needs-based, economically viable developments.
Economic equilibrium: the Guidelines propose to capitalise on the great financial dynamics of urban development on the waterfront, notably the dynamics generated by large-scale projects,. The variety of land uses, built environments and target customers and users makes it possible to develop a balanced portfolio of real estate products which commercialisation is less risky for developers. Such variety ensures proper end-to-end project development, qui participent à l’image du pays et à son attractivité. (#Sober developments)
Multiple uses of public spaces: mixed uses made for lively public spaces both by day and by night, during working hours and weekends. This combination of timescales helps to save space and to identify lively and attractive places for residents and tourists alike. Sur le waterfront, ils constituent la vitrine de Bahreïn dans le monde. (#A unique identity)
Reduced travel time: mixed uses and activities make it possible to concentrate several key functions in a single place, such as a restaurant close to a leisure area and to public transportation center. This enables the inhabitants to save time, energy and money by avoiding certain trips. It also reduces travel-related pollution. (#A healthy environment)
Related Keyword Definitions
Urban programming: the identification, quantification and definition of the functions of a space in line with its ambition, identified needs, market conditions, and the project’s economic feasibility as well as the spatial distribution of all these features.
Consistency: the overall harmony and complementarity obtained by assembling together different entities (buildings, open space, public realm) in compliance with specific rules governing forms, volumes, materials, etc.
Mixed use: diversity of functions in a neighbourhood (e.g. integration of an urban centre featuring convenience stores and small restaurants) or in a building (e.g. integration of a shop on the ground floor of a small housing block).</p>
<p>Safety and comfort:
To be attractive and lively, most coastal spaces are dedicated to non-motorised modes of mobility, particularly on foot. The public spaces allow the development of multiple uses: walking, picnicking, swimming, sports, etc. They provide opportunities for relaxing alone or in a group and for leisure activities and shopping. They are developed to ensure the comfort and safety of users throughout the day and the year.
Simple and safe street and road crossings: the crossing of streets and roads by pedestrians is made easier. This makes it possible to enhance the modal share of non-motorised means of transport compared with the motor car, notably regarding daily journeys or leisure trips.
Developments are focused on user needs: they take into account users’ needs for shade, lighting, drinking water, urban furniture, etc. This makes public spaces attractive to a large section of the population. Trade and shopping flows also benefit from this.
Pleasant and protected walkways: simplifying and shortening pedestrian walkways and providing shaded footpaths help to develop low-impact modes of mobility. The Waterfront becomes the best place to transform the mobility strategy and become a showcase for low-impact, non-motorised modes of mobility.
Sense of place
Bahrain's urban and trading tradition started on the waterfront: its unique identity is still  visible in all its historic urban centres. This environment comprises specific urban and architectural forms structured around lively public spaces that allow many different activities to co-exist. Bahrain's originality must be sustained and reinvented to adapt to new users and the new aspirations of its inhabitants.
Creating unique spaces: in order to avoid developments that are the same as all the others, the key policy is to bring out Bahraini waterfront specificities as much as possible by strengthening the ingredients of urbanity: diversity of function; high-quality public spaces; sufficient and well-distributed amenities and services; the promotion of internal mobility in conjunction with the existing urban areas. All these conditions make it possible to enhance the value, effectiveness and competitiveness of unique places for the benefit of local residents and visitors alike. (#a unique identity)
Related Keyword Definitions
Public realm: public space made up of roads and streets, but also open spaces, parks and gardens accessible to the public and which account for a large portion of unbuilt urban spaces. These interstitial spaces are used for travelling, leisure activities, exchanges, trade, etc. Their structure and design are adapted to local climate conditions and uses, enhance the inhabitants' quality of life and reinforce the identity of the places (sense of place).
Landscape: it comprises the visual urban environment in all its forms - built up areas, unbuilt areas, planted spaces, topography, etc. These components contribute to our perception of a place, its beauty and its originality.</p>
<p>1.4.2. Planning intents
Protect and preserve the waterfront:
Stabilize the coastline by allowing a variety of uses;
Prevent environmental hazards (floods, landslide, etc.);
Preserve natural and vulnerable areas from polluting human activities (cars, polluting industries, etc.).
Invent a Waterfront sense of place:
Enhance the waterfront landscape diversity;
Create an attractive public space adapted to the uses;
Enhance transition spaces quality.
Reconnection and accessibility:
Ensure an access to the sea for all;
Reconnect the waterfront and the city;
Facilitate mobilities along the waterfront.</p>
<p>2. Favour mixed-use development<br />
On the whole, the coastal spaces are attractive in terms of the diversity of programmes and users, encompassing informal and economic uses (fishing, horse-riding, housing, hospitality, service sector activities, etc.). This ensures the vitality of the Waterfront all year round, by day and by night.
The principles laid down in this chapter are based on those laid down in the Project Guidelines.  </p>
<p>2.1. General Programming Principles
A diversity of urban functions and construction programmes is planned along the coastline: their strategic importance is due to their being located on the coastline rather than in other parts of Bahrain.
Programming will alternate quiet coastline segments with livelier ones;
Respect linear continuity featuring complementary centres of varying intensity.
Programming will endeavour to maintain existing activities, income generating or leisure, and ensure new development improves conditions and operations. To that purpose, consultation with existing users should be undertaken at the programming stage.</p>
<p>2.2. Specific Requirements for each perimetre</p>
<p>Exclusion strip
An unbuilt area made up of open spaces and light structures.
No building will be permitted, except for light, temporary structures.
The non-constructible area will be mainly dedicated to non-motorised low-impact modes of mobility and to open spaces.
The programme will include visitor information facilities.</p>
<p>Seafront
This area corresponds to the first built frontage and to the exits of the perpendicular access ways to the sea.
The programme will sustain or enhance pre-existing uses, be they leisure (swimming, horse-riding) or economic (fishing, arts and crafts).
Land uses that impose restrictions on access will be prohibited in order to ensure public access to the beach and easements for pedestrian access (resorts, compounds, etc.).
The programming of activities relating directly to the Waterfront will evolve over time (temporary use/occupation of vacant lots, etc.).
Residential land uses will be balanced between locals, expats and tourists.
The hotel construction programmes will favour structures that respect the natural environment and landscape, and which complement the existing hotel offering.
Parking lots will not be visible on the seafront. Their preferred location will be landside.
Seafront facilities that meet the needs of local residents shall be accessible for both residents and visitors. It will be given the possibility of derogating from the maximum authorised distances between them;</p>
<p>Landside<br />
favour services and facilities that meet the needs of residents, economically active people and visitors to foster a diversity of users.
Projects that do not feature continuity with an existing urban fabric will have to be particularly autonomous from an employment point of view (with an Employment Concentration Indicator of between 0.6 and 1);
dynamic hubs will be located at the interface between tourist areas and neighbouring living quarters. They will be easily accessible from the seafront;
Developments located near the Waterfront will have to set their supply of parking spaces back from the seafront</p>
<p>2.3. Specific Requirements per SPA</p>
<p>*Beach areas
Public spaces are fragile and not numerous in this part of the city, so public access to it must be organised. More amenities need to be introduced taking into account developments in the immediate vicinity.
The programme will ensure that the public can use the beaches, which means preventing privatisation by establishing spaces open to the public and accessible by non-motorized pathways all along the coastline.
The programme lays down the linear development of walkways or non-motorised low-impact connections set back from the beach to delineate the entrance to the public space and to clearly indicate the urbanisation boundary.
The construction programme for each segment will have to meet the needs of a broad range of users (including spaces for workers or tourists to change clothes and picnic and playgrounds for residents' children, et.).</p>

Pedestrian access easement shall always be located on exclusion strip;
This exclusion strip is part of coastal protection against erosion as described in part 5;
Pedestrian access easement:
Moving along the Waterfront will be allowed by means of a public pedestrian access easement.
The easement’s strip of land may remain privately owned so long as the right to cross it is made possible.
It will be 6m wide in most contexts. Some 1.5m wide pedestrian easements could be accepted in very constrained sites or residential areas.
To provide continuity along the Waterfront, it will be connected to the surrounding road network and open spaces, if any.
If a residential road is planned by the sea, the pedestrian easement will be integrated into it (the road profile will have to be adapted).
The design of edges on both sides as well as on city side will avoid any "walling off" effect to favour a "plug in" design.
The pedestrian easement will be continuous between two contiguous projects in terms of width, surfacing, levelling. A financial contribution by riparian owners will enable the easement to be created and kept in good condition by the local authority.</p>
<p>Implement continuous walkways wherever possible along the waterfront</p>
<p>Pedestrian easements accessible to the public should be developed whose width will vary according to the sites. (A minimum width of 1.5m in front of private residential developments or very constrained sites).</p>
<p>*Beaches areas
A 100-metre-wide exclusion strip alongside the beaches free of any form of urban development must be respected.
Light and removable structures may be proposed in this strip. They must relate to fishing or beach activities (restaurants, clubs, children’s games, fish markets, etc.) and must not adversely affect the sites).
Public spaces must help guide users towards the beaches (signage, landscaping, etc.), facilitate their access to them and preserve the quality of the coastline.
Shops and leisure facilities must be easily accessible from the beaches and public ports.</p>
<p>A 100-metre-wide exclusion strip alongside the beaches</p>
<p>*Reclamation
80% of shoreline land reclaims must be accessible to the public in the form of open spaces and spaces for non-motorised low impact modes of transport. Linear shore developments will include the canals inside reclaimed spaces. .</p>
<p>Rendre accessible 80 % des berges sur reclaim</p>
<p>Exemple de promenade piétonne sur les berges</p>
<p>Vary the relationships with the sea by developing the shores</p>
<p>The following guidance will apply to the exclusion strip:
Each development will be consistent with the type of seafront concerned (see Strategic Plan) and, if necessary, with the recommendations specific to the relevant sectors (see the public space charter, etc.).
The treatment of the coastline will feature diversified overhanging terraces or pathways, islands and floating jetties, piers, etc.).
Development of the shores will have to ensure continuity between the different developments (in terms of profile and width).
Coarse rock protection (riprap) will not exceed 30% of the coastline. Embankments allowing access to the water (steps, etc.) will be favoured.
Direct access points to water will be placed every 300m at the most.
The development of walkways very close to the water (low level walkways) will be favoured. This type of walkway also guarantees the privacy of adjacent homes (see Ch. 4.2 on boundaries). ).</p>
<p>Exemple d’aménagements d’espaces ouverts en littoral
3.2. Facilitate access to the coastline from adjacent neighbourhoods
Create transversal access
Access to the waterfront via public access ways shall be ensured at least every 500 m.
These access ways will give priority to non-motorized mobility modes and have at least the width of a footpath (see Road Hierarchy of the Strategic Plan and Project Guidelines);
All new development in contact with the waterfront shall provide new access way to it, even if it is located between two existing access easements distant from 500m or less.
These access ways will preferably be rectilinear to ensure view corridors towards the coastline (see 4.1);</p>
<p>Un accès public au rivage doit être assuré tous les 500 m à minima</p>
<p>*Built up Waterfront   <br />
In the built-up parts of the Waterfront, access to the shore from public roads must be provided at least every 300 metres.
Access ways to the shoreline should ensure continuity with the existing road network.
When developing corridors, priority will be given to direct connections with public transport stops and stations (bus, LRT, etc.).
When there are obstacles (expressways, etc), connections will be provided using elevated or underground structures.
elevated or underground access ways will be attractive and comfortable, with ramps for bicycles and prams as well as shade and water supply.</p>
<p>There must be access ways to the shore from public roads at least every 300 metres in built-up areas</p>
<p>The number of pedestrian corridors leading to the shoreline must be multiplied and take the most suitable forms (pedestrian crossings, footbridges, etc.)</p>
<p>*Beaches areas
The developments will make access to the beaches easier by including a public transport line featuring:<br />
a stop next to the beach itself
alleyways and corridors guiding passengers to the beaches
Parking lots will be clearly identified and delineated. They should be as invisible as possible from the seafront (integrated landscaping, plantations, incline, etc.)
If part of the beach is conceded to private operators, the 1.5 meter-wide (minimum) transversal and longitudinal pedestrian easements will be maintained.</p>
<p>Access to public beaches must be facilitated by a good connection with public transport facilities near the public parking lots</p>
<p>3.3. Turning the Waterfront into a showcase for virtuous modes of mobility
Foster the integration of public transport and road sharing
The road network shall adapt to the national tourism strategy (BTEA shall be consulted). The dimensions of access ways to the sea (capacity and parking) will depend on programming (land use and the expected number of users).
A specific road order shall be developed for the pedestrian transversal and longitudinal access easement and the coastal promenades. In line with the local and national mobility plan (Strategic Plan), the road profiles will ensure the integration:
of public transport: integrated bus lines, BRT, tramway lines;
of non-motorized mobility modes: pedestrians, cyclists, horse riders, etc;
of innovative forms of mobility: self-service bike sharing, shuttle services.</p>
<p>Privilégier les streets avec trottoirs de chaque côté en waterfront et optimiser le confort usager</p>
<p>Two-way street</p>
<p>One-way street
Improve connectivity between shore and islands
Pedestrian crossings and maritime transport links (taxi boats, etc.) may connect shores;
Foster public transport via waterways connecting different areas;
Pedestrian access to private islands, their roads and shorelines will be authorised.
Treatment of the coastline will favour the mooring of boats. Landing stages for boat shuttles (water taxis) will be available every 500m in dense urban areas.
Effective integration of heavy infrastructures
Seaside roads with heavy traffic (Distributor roads and above) will be turned into peaceful urban boulevards thanks to speed limits, traffic lights, suitably dimensioned roads, public transport lanes, wide sidewalks and street-level (ground floor) retail outlets, etc.
Local roads will optimize the functioning of services related to tourism and ports. Their integration into the immediate environment will be studied to avoid visual and physical barriers;
The presence of heavy infrastructures (highways, utility corridors, elevated transport lines, etc) along the coast will be avoided as much as possible on the water's edge. Otherwise, the following principles will apply:
They will be well-integrated into their environment to avoid visual and physical barriers.
Their impact will be limited thanks to devices such as plantations and the permeability and porosity characteristics of materials for ground cover.
Their presence will be offset by the development of:
Adjacent protected walkways for non-motorised mobility
Open and/or natural spaces developed onsite or elsewhere
The positioning of regular crossings (see 3.2)</p>
<p>Positionner les infrastructures lourdes en retrait du waterfront</p>
<p>*Built up Waterfront   <br />
The impact of heavy roads infrastructures on the Waterfront such as motorways must be reduced as much as possible with the help of various devices:
Creating buffer zones using recesses and spaces with green plants, etc.
Locating buildings that act as screens, such as office blocks, closed sports facilities shopping centres, etc.<br />
Burying new roads</p>

<ol>
<li>Stage the waterfront
4.1. Reveal the coastal and seaboard landscape
The various schemes proposed here enable people to feel the presence of the seafront on different scales, reminding them of the insular nature of the Kingdom's identity.
Improve the perception of the sea from the coast and the adjacent neighbourhoods
Depending on each site's geographical context (heights, contours, etc.) it is necessary to preserve the existing views of the sea and to plan extra vistas;
Points of interest will be highlighted by developing vantage points (belvederes, etc.):
wherever the shape of the coast is suitable (capes, etc.);
wherever facing remarkable coastal landscape (islands, urban or port skylines, etc.);
Set the hierarchy of views in accordance with the requirements of the developments.
Create a remarkable "coastal landscape"
The planning of seafront built and non-built forms helps to create a coastal landscape visible from the sea and the coastline facing each other;
The diversity of built forms should ensure avoidance of monotonous urban frontage and the emergence of a remarkable skyline;
Planners will seek to find the appropriate seaboard sequences to highlight unique places and extend the range of uses;
These sequences will leverage existing landmarks such as the natural heritage or historic monuments or even new future landmarks such as public space facilities (structures designed to command fine views, art installations, lighting, etc.);
The streetscapes and built forms shall be consistent with the landscaping strategy and well integrated into landscaped corridors or facing remarkable vistas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Points of interest and various views highlighted</p>
<p>4.2. Invent a waterfront sense of place
Attractive and comfortable public spaces
In addition to the recommendations given in Part 3, the coastal promenade will be shaded (30% of the linear length) and provide drinking water supply points at regular intervals (every 300m);
Developments will be accessible to persons with reduced mobility.
The comfort of pedestrians' and a variety of user walkways and promenades will be enhanced thanks to shading and cooling features:
shade houses, vegetation, arcades;
the use of materials that reduce noise and heat;
lighting
keeping sources of heat at a distance (A/C emissions, cars parked with engines running, etc.);
The technical properties of materials for pavements and ground cover shall ensure maximum noise reduction and mitigation of the effects of heat.
Public spaces shall be serviced by transport facilities (public transport, parking lots, etc.); this recommendation shall apply as a priority to coastal promenades and access corridors;
Materials and furniture shall facilitate legibility.
Boundaries that enhance the quality of the landscape
The first alignment of buildings will benefit from the view onto the sea while preserving a sufficient degree of privacy;
The privacy of residential developments will be treated by other means than blind walls (forbidden): inclines, light shafts, depth of plantations, etc.
Setbacks and unbuilt parts of plots will be sufficiently wide to be usable (for gardens, patios, etc.) and will preferably be planted;
If the coastal promenade (pedestrian longitudinal easement) is located right in front of the first line of buildings, an exclusion strip at least two meters wide will be respected and preferably planted.</p>
<p>*Built up Waterfront
Le paysage et le mobilier urbains doivent faciliter les déplacements de la ville jusqu’au front de mer;
Ils doivent être reliés à des moyens de transport (transports publics, parkings...).</p>
<p>*Beach areas
Set back from the beaches (exclusion zone), the recommended open spaces will be generously planted with vegetation to:
provide shaded spaces for picnicking and other uses;
highlight the views on to the sea;
accommodate and integrate parking lots and the light structures recommended for this strip;
offer an alternation of dry and "fresh" irrigated gardens.
80% of spaces dedicated to pedestrian access ways must be shaded between 9am and 4pm.</p>
<p>*Beaches areas
Les structures temporaires et les dispositifs d’éclairage peuvent être autorisés sur les plages ou dans leur zones tampons.
Ils doivent être localisés de manières à permettre l’accès et la visibilité du waterfront.</p>
<p>4.3. Adapt built forms
Create a coastal urban front
For mega projects, this means defining architectural sequences that are relevant to land and coastal uses. Height variations will create a dynamic waterfront, displaying various views /images;
All waterfront developments should feature both seaside and landside façades. If the main façade is seaside, the other façade will be treated with the same care. Blind facades are forbidden on the seaside and shall be avoided;
The architecture of the buildings facing the sea will take advantage of this situation with openings, balconies, loggias, etc;
Technical structures of all kinds (reservoirs, AC, aerials, displays, etc.) will have to be integrated into the façades and the roofs;
Electricity substations will be incorporated into the buildings. They will not be placed on the seafront or in the visual fields of the transversal corridors. They will be located in accordance with the need for accessibility/visibility.
Ensure porosity of the urban façade
New developments or buildings shall not obstruct views on the waterfront;
Building footprint shall be maximum 50% of total site area;
Limit barrier effect by limiting facade length:
The built up ratio over total length of the frontage should not be more than 70%
Continuous built facade should not be more than 30m
Limit heights with ascending height further away from the sealine, taller buildings should be located inland.</p>
<p>*Built up Waterfront
Views of the sea visible between buildings will be multiplied
The planned new buildings will respect continuity with existing buildings to preserve visual openings between buildings.
Priority will be given to developments on vacant land in sectors whose urbanisation has not been completed. In other words, before developing non-urbanised sectors, the lots for development in already urbanised sectors must be 80% built.</p>

<p>Sustainable coastal developments
5.1. Greening the Waterfront
Waterfront developments must contribute to recreating the vegetable cover:
The selected species of vegetable will help to stabilise the soil, reinforce biodiversity and depollute the ground.
By providing shade and freshness (irrigated gardens), the selected vegetable species will enhance the comfort of pedestrian public spaces.
The chosen vegetable species will make it possible to create a unique landscape (in terms of heights, colours, etc.)
The vegetable pallets will be compatible with their coastline location and the overall objectives set in part 5 of the "Green Guidelines" manual.
At least 30% of the surface area of the exclusion strip will be planted. Waterfront linear parks will be introduced.
5.2. Adapting developments to movements of the coastline and avoiding erosion
Developments shall not stop the natural movement of the coastline:
Fixed structures that make the ground rigid are to be avoided, such as foundations, works involving injections into the soil, etc.;
Means of stabilisation and demarcation (plantations, cable barriers, etc.) should be flexible rather than rigid (parapets, dykes);
Pedestrian walkways right next to the coastline shall be adaptable to changing coastal movements: wooden paths, planted paths, etc;
Developments shall not accelerate the erosion of the coastline:
Grassy areas should be preserved;
Digging in development areas shall be limited as much as possible, particularly if they contain sludge or vegetation;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>5.3. Limit wastewater discharges
Developments in waterfront areas should avoid discharge of wastewater into the sea by using the collective wastewater disposal network. In the rare cases where this solution may not be possible:
A note shall be published proving that all alternative solutions to discharging have been studied;
Parcel-based treatment should be implemented to produce dischargeable effluent compliant with the chosen benchmarks (e.g. LEED: tertiary treatment level, HQE: chemical characteristics etc.)</p>
<p>5.4. Materials
Giving priority to materials and developments with the longest possible life-cycles
All forms of reinforced concrete will be calculated to achieve long-term resilience in marine environments. This also applies to non-immersed structures: use of cement suitable for sea water; use of stainless steel frames or of cathodic protection; water/binder ratio ranging from 0.5 to 0.45, etc.;
Study the option of using wood to make structures subject to drawdown: piers, pontoons, stilts, etc.;
Suitable protective covering will be used (coating, resin, etc.) to ensure the durability of façades and solar production subject to abrasion and scratching.
Light infrastructures located in the exclusion strip must be mobile and partly replaceable (e.g. replacing part of the planks of a walkway). They should not require heavy deconstruction work in case of coastline movements.</p>

FOCUS: LIVERPOOL WATERS, Liverpool, UK
The Liverpool Waters project is a 50-year transformation of the historical industrial city-centre into a dynamic central urban hub.
It is built around several sequences rhythmically composed of a variety of construction programmes (see illustration).
The starting-point was the positioning of key cultural and educational facilities (museums, academic institutions) as well as amenities directly linked to the water (sailing school, marinas, ferry service, boat dealers, etc.). This has contributed to the development of retail and leisure support facilities.</p>
